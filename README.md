This is just a quick python script to add screenshot functionality to Fedora. Nothing too serious.
I use the gnome-screenshot command with flag -a so you can take a screenshot of whatever size you like. 
I use Tkinter to put a button onto the screen to show you the last picture you took (hopefully) or let you take a screenshot.
